    <!-- There seems to be no end in sight for the uneasy relationship between the coalition partners, with top Janata Dal (Secular) leaders on Wednesday taking turns to blame Congress leaders, including former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah obliquely, for the differences coming out in public.

    Amidst rants by Congress legislators over the functioning of the coalition government in the past week, both Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, and JD(S) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda accused them of tarnishing the work of the government.
    
    Mr. Gowda went as far as to caution the Congress leadership that it should take action before things get out of hand. -->
